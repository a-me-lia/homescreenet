Generally, there are a few requisites:

- Clean
- Safe
- Uncrowded
- Human needs are easily met (water, food, easy access to bathrooms in case your date is in pain)

The best places are often not the cliche romantic venues, like restaurants (0/10, bad date idea), but niche venues that only you and your date enjoy for specific reasons.

Heres some good locations:

- The Edge NYC, good location near hudson yards NYC. As opposed to the rest of the city, Lower Manhattan and especially around Hudson Yards, the Highline and Little Island are very modern, clean and developed places perfect for a stroll near sunset.
