After going on the first date in my life with my love the cutest shrimp girl, I reflected upon what are some good, and not so good date venues.

Generally, there are a few requisites:
- Clean
- Safe
- Uncrowded
- Human needs are easily met (water, food, easy access to bathrooms in case your date is in pain)

The best places are often not the cliche romantic venues, like restaurants (0/10, bad date idea), but niche venues that only you and your date enjoy for specific reasons.


For example, my girl really doesn't like crowded people, and wanted to see the stars with me sometime, so a top tier date venue could be the mountain lodge on the Amecolola Trailhead for example.

Heres an (imcomplete) list of some other places I personally would take the love of my life:

- The Edge NYC, good location near hudson yards NYC. As opposed to the rest of the city, Lower Manhattan and especially around Hudson Yards, the Highline and Little Island are very modern, clean and developed places perfect for a stroll near sunset.
- A beach in 東北
- A love hotel in Shibuya
